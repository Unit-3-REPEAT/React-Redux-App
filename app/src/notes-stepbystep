//STEP 1 -- Create a reducer and set up the initialState 
//STEP 2 -- import reducer, import provider and createStore function inside index.js
//STEP 3 -- Connect desired component to the redux store - import connect.

//connect gets called twice
//first call we pass in the mapsStateToProps and an object
//second call we pass in the component we want to connect to redux store

//action creators
//inside connect

//UNDER THE HOOD CONNECT DOES THIS
// dispatch(toggleEdditing()) ==> dispatch({type: "TOGGLE_EDITING"})
//connect adds the action creator function to props - when props.xxx is called, connect
//will call dispatch and dispatch the returned action object

//Step 4 - create mapStateToProps
//mSTP brings the state from reducer into the props of the AdditionalFeature component
//and merges them together - it returns the object and each property is added to the props
//of the connected component
